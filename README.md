# Location-Mapping-using-Python


This Python code snippet demonstrates how to use the requests library to fetch real-time data about the International Space Station's (ISS) current location from the Open Notify API. The code starts by importing the requests library, then constructs an HTTP GET request to the API's "http://api.open-notify.org/iss-now.json" endpoint. It checks the HTTP response's status code for errors and, if successful, parses the JSON response to extract and print the ISS's latitude and longitude coordinates. This code can serve as a simple example for developers interested in making HTTP requests to external APIs and handling JSON responses in Python, particularly when working with real-time data sources like the ISS location data.
